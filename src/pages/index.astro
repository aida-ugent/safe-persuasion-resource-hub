			<strong>LLM Persuasion Safety Hub</strong> is a collection of datasets and codebases used to study
			and evaluate persuasion in large language models (LLMs). The goal is to bring together the most
			relevant resources as they emerge, making safety-relevant LLM persuasion research easier to discover,
			compare, and reproduce.
			<br />
			<br />
			This initiative grew out of work on a survey of automatic persuasion evaluation methods:
